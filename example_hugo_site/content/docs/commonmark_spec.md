# Plain Markdown

This page contains examples of plain Markdown. It should include any non-shortcode markup that we want the migration to support.

## Inline text formatting

You can _italicize_ text, or **bold** it.

Text can also be formatted as a [plain link][1], **[bold link][1]**, or _[italic link][1]_.

## Lists

### Ordered

Here's an ordered list of steps:

1. Figure out how to migrate to [Astro][2].
2. Make some _incredible docs_.
3. **Profit.**

### Unordered

Here's an unordered version of the same list, which doesn't make as much sense, but that's okay.

- Figure out how to migrate to [Astro][2].
- Make some _incredible docs_.
- **Profit.**
