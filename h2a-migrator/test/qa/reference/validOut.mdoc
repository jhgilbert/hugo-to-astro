# Plain Markdown

This page contains examples of plain Markdown. It should include any non-shortcode markup that we want the migration to support.

## Inline text formatting

You can _italicize_ text, or **bold** it.

Text can also be formatted as a [plain link](https://www.google.com), **[bold link](https://www.google.com)**, or _[italic link](https://www.google.com)_.

## Lists

### Ordered

Here's an ordered list of steps:

1. Figure out how to migrate to [Astro](https://astro.build/).
1. Make some _incredible docs_.
1. **Profit.**

### Unordered

Here's an unordered version of the same list, which doesn't make as much sense, but that's okay.

- Figure out how to migrate to [Astro](https://astro.build/).
- Make some _incredible docs_.
- **Profit.**

## Code

```javascript
console.log("Hello, world!");
```
